# Web API Optimization Opportunities

This document tracks opportunities to replace manual implementations with native Web APIs for better performance, smaller bundle size, and improved user experience.

## Status Legend
- 🎯 **High Priority** - Significant impact, relatively easy to implement
- 📊 **Medium Priority** - Good impact, moderate complexity
- 💡 **Low Priority** - Minor improvement or higher complexity
- ✅ **Completed** - Already implemented
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies or browser support

---

## 1. Remove Unused `base64_encode` Function ✅

**Status**: Completed
**File**: `src/utils_wasm.rs:7-19`
**Current**: Custom base64 encoding using browser's `btoa()`
**Opportunity**: Function is no longer used after switching to object URLs

**Action**: Remove the function entirely to reduce code complexity and bundle size.

**Estimated Impact**:
- Bundle size: -0.5 KB
- Maintainability: Simpler codebase
- Performance: No change (not being used)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Verify no references exist with `cargo test`
- Remove function and re-run tests
- Update exports if necessary

---

## 2. Use `requestIdleCallback()` for Hash Calculation ✅

**Status**: Completed
**File**: `src/utils_hash.rs:6-26`, `src/exif_wasm.rs:66-67,102`
**Current**: Hash calculation runs immediately on file upload
**Better Alternative**: [requestIdleCallback()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback)

**Benefits**:
- ✨ Better perceived performance (UI stays responsive)
- 🔋 Better battery life on mobile devices
- 🎨 Doesn't block rendering or user interactions
- 📱 Smoother experience on lower-end devices

**Implementation Strategy**:
```rust
// Wrap hash calculation in idle callback
let idle_callback = Closure::wrap(Box::new(move |_deadline: web_sys::IdleDeadline| {
    wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local(async move {
        let hash = calculate_sha256_hash(&bytes).await;
        // Update UI with hash
    });
}) as Box<dyn FnMut(_)>);

window.request_idle_callback(idle_callback.as_ref().unchecked_ref());
```

**Fallback**: If `requestIdleCallback` is not available, fall back to immediate execution

**Estimated Impact**:
- Performance: 10-20% better perceived load time
- UX: Smoother uploads, especially for batch operations
- Complexity: Low (straightforward wrapper)

---

## 3. Use Web Workers for Batch Processing 🎯

**Status**: Not started
**Files**:
- `src/components/file_upload.rs:41-71` (batch file processing)
- `src/components/archive_import.rs` (ZIP extraction)
- `src/utils_hash.rs` (hash calculation)

**Current**: All processing happens on main thread
**Better Alternative**: [Web Workers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)

**Benefits**:
- 🚀 True parallelism for batch operations
- 🎯 Main thread stays fully responsive
- ⚡ Better performance on multi-core devices
- 📦 Can process multiple files simultaneously

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Create a dedicated WASM worker module
2. Move heavy operations to worker:
   - EXIF extraction
   - SHA-256 hashing
   - Image dimension calculation
3. Use message passing between main thread and worker
4. Show progress updates during batch processing

**Complexity**: High - requires architectural changes

**Estimated Impact**:
- Performance: 50-200% faster batch operations (depending on CPU cores)
- UX: Dramatically better responsiveness during batch uploads
- Bundle size: +2-3 KB for worker setup

**Notes**:
- Consider using [wasm-bindgen-rayon](https://github.com/RReverser/wasm-bindgen-rayon) for easier parallel processing
- May require SharedArrayBuffer support (has security requirements)

## 4. Use `showSaveFilePicker()` for Better Download UX 📊

**Status**: Not started
**Files**:
- `src/utils_wasm.rs:22-53` (text downloads)
- `src/utils_wasm.rs:68-103` (binary downloads)

**Current**: Creating hidden anchor elements to trigger downloads
**Better Alternative**: [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API)

**Benefits**:
- 🎯 User can choose exact download location
- 📱 Better mobile browser support
- 🧹 No DOM manipulation needed
- ♿ Better accessibility
- 🔄 Can overwrite files without duplicate naming

**Implementation Strategy**:
```rust
async fn download_with_picker(content: &str, filename: &str, mime_type: &str) -> Result<(), JsValue> {
    let window = web_sys::window().unwrap();

    // Try modern API first
    if let Ok(picker) = window.show_save_file_picker() {
        let file_handle = wasm_bindgen_futures::JsFuture::from(picker).await?;
        // Write content to file
    } else {
        // Fallback to current anchor method
        download_file_legacy(content, filename, mime_type);
    }
}
```

**Browser Support**:
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Full support
- Safari: ❌ Not yet (use fallback)
- Firefox: ⚠️ Behind flag (use fallback)

**Estimated Impact**:
- UX: Much better download experience where supported
- Complexity: Medium (requires feature detection + fallback)

---

## 5. Use `CompressionStream` for ZIP Creation 📊

**Status**: Not started
**File**: `src/components/batch_cleaner.rs:58-108`
**Current**: Using Rust `zip` crate (compiled to WASM)
**Better Alternative**: [CompressionStream API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompressionStream)

**Benefits**:
- 📦 Reduce WASM bundle size (remove `zip` dependency)
- ⚡ Native browser compression is highly optimized
- 🔧 Less code to maintain
- 🌊 Streaming compression (better memory usage)

**Implementation Strategy**:
```rust
// Use native compression
let compression_stream = web_sys::CompressionStream::new("deflate")?;
let writer = compression_stream.writable().get_writer()?;

// Write files to stream
for file in files {
    writer.write_with_u8_array(&file_data).await?;
}
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ❌ Cannot create actual ZIP format (need to build ZIP structure manually)
- ✅ Can use for GZIP compression of batch exports
- ✅ Perfect for single-file compression

**Alternative Approach**:
Keep Rust `zip` crate for actual ZIP archives, but use `CompressionStream` for individual file compression within the archive.

**Browser Support**:
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ 80+
- Safari: ✅ 16.4+
- Firefox: ✅ 113+

**Estimated Impact**:
- Bundle size: -50 KB (if fully replacing zip crate)
- Performance: 10-30% faster compression
- Complexity: High (need to build ZIP structure manually)

**Recommendation**: Consider for future optimization, not immediate priority.

## 6. Use `OffscreenCanvas` for Image Dimensions 💡

**Status**: Not started
**File**: `src/exif_wasm.rs:40-48`
**Current**: Using Rust `image` crate to get dimensions
**Better Alternative**: [OffscreenCanvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas)

**Benefits**:
- 🧵 Can run off main thread
- ⚡ Potentially faster for large images
- 🎨 Native browser optimization
- 📦 Could reduce bundle size if image crate is removed elsewhere

**Implementation Strategy**:
```rust
async fn get_image_dimensions_native(blob: &web_sys::Blob) -> Result<(u32, u32), JsValue> {
    let bitmap = wasm_bindgen_futures::JsFuture::from(
        web_sys::window()?.create_image_bitmap_with_blob(blob)?
    ).await?;

    let bitmap: web_sys::ImageBitmap = bitmap.dyn_into()?;
    Ok((bitmap.width(), bitmap.height()))
}
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Works great for web-native formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- ❌ May not support all formats we currently support (TIFF, HEIF)
- ✅ Doesn't require decoding entire image

**Browser Support**:
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Full support
- Safari: ✅ Full support
- Firefox: ✅ Full support

**Estimated Impact**:
- Performance: 5-15% faster for large images
- Bundle size: Neutral (still need `image` crate for EXIF extraction)
- Complexity: Medium (need format detection and fallback)

**Recommendation**: Low priority - current implementation works well.

## 7. Use `structuredClone()` for Deep Cloning 💡

**Status**: Not started
**Opportunity**: When cloning complex objects in React/Yew components
**Better Alternative**: [structuredClone()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone)

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Faster than manual JSON serialization/deserialization
- 🔧 Handles complex objects (including typed arrays, blobs)
- 🎯 Native implementation

**Current Usage**: We use Rust's `Clone` trait, which is already optimal

**Estimated Impact**: Minimal - Rust's clone is already efficient

**Recommendation**: Not applicable - Rust handles this well natively.
