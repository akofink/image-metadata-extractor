# Roadmap: Image Metadata Extractor (Client‚ÄëSide Only)

This roadmap outlines a privacy‚Äëfirst, fully client‚Äëside evolution of the Image Metadata Extractor. It is organized into phases with clear goals, user‚Äëfacing features, technical notes, and testing criteria. Dates are intentionally omitted; sequence may adapt based on community needs and browser platform capabilities.

Guiding principles:
- 100% client‚Äëside (no servers, no tracking, no external storage of user data).
- Privacy by design (opt‚Äëin UI features, safe defaults, no network calls required for core features).
- Rust + WebAssembly + Yew (type safety, performance, maintainability).
- Performance and accessibility are first‚Äëclass requirements.

Non‚Äëgoals:
- No server‚Äëside processing or persistent cloud storage.
- No analytics/telemetry that sends data off device.
- No reliance on paid third‚Äëparty APIs for core functionality.

---

## What will make this the most useful tool on the Internet

Unique differentiators (all client‚Äëside):
- Archive & dataset native: Import ZIP/7z/TAR archives, deduplicate by hash, and process at scale without uploading files anywhere.
- Cross‚Äëfile intelligence: Timeline view, location clustering heatmap, and cross‚Äëimage diff/dedupe to analyze entire shoots.
- Privacy score & guidance: Automatic sensitive‚Äëfield warnings, GPS precision fuzzing, and share‚Äësafety checklist with clear remediation.
- Templated reporting: Custom, user‚Äëdefined report templates (Markdown/HTML/TXT) with local profile storage and schema versioning.
- Minimal video metadata: Parse container metadata (MP4/MOV) and embedded XMP/EXIF sidecar basics to extend usefulness beyond still images.
- Power‚Äëuser experience: Command palette, keyboard shortcuts, rule‚Äëbased redaction engine, and offline quick‚Äëmap preview (no external tiles).
- Internationalization: Built‚Äëin multilingual UI and field explanations, shipped with the app (no network fetch).

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Quality, UX, and Export Depth

Objectives: improve the core experience, expand export options, and enable multi‚Äëfile workflows while keeping memory use and performance tight.

User‚Äëfacing features:
- ‚úÖ **Batch support (multi file)**: **IMPLEMENTED**
  - ‚úÖ Drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop multiple images; process sequentially with progress reporting.
  - ‚úÖ Previous/Next navigation buttons for switching between processed files.
  - üîÑ Export combined metadata (single JSON/CSV/TXT) and per‚Äëfile outputs.
  - üîÑ Batch cleaning; optional ZIP download of cleaned files.
- Archive input:
  - Import ZIP/TAR (and explore 7z feasibility) directly; list, filter, and process selected files.
  - Streamed extraction in WASM to avoid large memory spikes.
- Export enhancements:
  - Additional formats: YAML, XML, and Markdown report.
  - Templated reports: user‚Äëdefined templates for Markdown/HTML/TXT with local persistence.
  - Per‚Äëcategory export profiles (save/load locally) for repeatable selections.
  - Copy to clipboard for JSON/CSV/TXT/Markdown.
  - Stable schemas: include schema version, deterministic ordering, and optional JSON‚ÄëLD context.
- UX polish:
  - ‚úÖ **Dark mode and system theme auto‚Äëdetection**: **IMPLEMENTED**
  - Command palette and keyboard shortcuts for import, select all, export, clean.
  - Improved keyboard navigation and focus management.
  - Persistent UI preferences (theme, default export options) via localStorage.
  - Basic i18n: at least EN + one additional language, with local bundles.
- GPS privacy options:
  - Degrade precision (fuzz or round to N decimal places/meters) before export.
  - Geofencing presets (e.g., home/work polygons) to auto‚Äëredact within defined areas.
  - Easy copy of map links (Apple/Google/OSM) without contacting third parties by default.
- Integrity checks & hashing:
  - SHA‚Äë256 hashing for files (for dedupe and provenance reporting).
  - Quick consistency checks (e.g., GPSRef vs. sign, DateTime vs. SubSec, Orientation presence).

Technical notes:
- Use Web Workers to keep UI responsive for long‚Äërunning parsing/exports.
- Consider OffscreenCanvas for image cleaning in workers where supported.
- Client‚Äëside ZIP creation for batch export/clean using a WASM‚Äëfriendly crate.
- Archive readers (ZIP/TAR) compiled to WASM; stream via Blob.slice and async iterators.
- Avoid large in‚Äëmemory spikes by streaming reads and chunked processing.

Testing & acceptance:
- wasm‚Äëbindgen‚Äëtest coverage for batch flows, archive import, templates, and new export formats.
- Cross‚Äëbrowser manual matrix for Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge.
- Performance target: process 50 JPEGs (24MP) or a 1‚Äì2 GB ZIP without tab lockup on a mid‚Äërange laptop.

## Phase 2 ‚Äî PWA, Persistence, and Advanced Cleaning Controls

Objectives: make the app installable and resilient offline, improve large‚Äëdataset workflows, and provide granular cleaning/redaction controls.

User‚Äëfacing features:
- PWA: installable, offline support, app icon, splash screen.
- Session persistence:
  - IndexedDB for caching parsed metadata, thumbnails, and archive indices (opt‚Äëin).
  - Resume interrupted batch operations.
- Directory import (where supported):
  - File System Access API to select folders, with recursive scanning.
- Advanced cleaning controls:
  - Redact fields by category or key pattern; custom rulesets.
  - Timestamp shift (e.g., +/‚Äë offset) for export without revealing exact times.
  - Preserve orientation/ICC selectively while stripping identifiers.
  - Write‚Äëback (limited): allow author/copyright insertion and removal of selected fields for JPEG/PNG where safe.
- Side‚Äëby‚Äëside diff view: Original vs. Cleaned metadata comparison.
- Offline quick‚Äëmap preview:
  - Lightweight, internal SVG world map with projected coordinate dot for basic visualization (no external tiles).

Technical notes:
- Cross‚Äëorigin isolation (COOP/COEP) + threads for WASM SIMD/parallelism where possible.
- IndexedDB abstraction for safe, bounded storage (eviction strategy, quotas).
- Rule engine for cleaning: compile a set of predicates to include/exclude/transform keys.
- Minimal EXIF write path for limited, safe tag updates; robust validation to avoid corrupting files.

Testing & acceptance:
- Offline functionality verification (no network required for core use).
- Property‚Äëbased tests for rule engine transformations and write‚Äëback safety.
- Bundle size target: keep release WASM under a reasonable limit; document tradeoffs.

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Metadata Coverage, Analytics, and Forensics

Objectives: deepen metadata parsing breadth, cross‚Äëfile analytics, and non‚Äëdestructive inspection tools for photographers, journalists, and analysts.

User‚Äëfacing features:
- Metadata breadth:
  - IPTC and XMP parsing and export (where available in files).
  - MakerNotes surface (best‚Äëeffort, vendor‚Äëspecific keys with disclaimers).
- Cross‚Äëfile analytics:
  - Timeline view grouped by day/session; clock‚Äëskew helper for multi‚Äëcamera shoots.
  - Location clustering and heatmap (SVG) from GPS points; quick anonymization toggles.
  - Multi‚Äëimage metadata diff (select N images and compare).
- Forensics/insight tools (client‚Äëonly):
  - Quick histogram and dominant colors visualization.
  - Detected color profile and bit depth reporting.
  - Basic thumbnail preview extraction from EXIF (if present).
  - Basic ELA (error level analysis) preview for JPEG to highlight recompression areas.
- Smart suggestions: flag potentially sensitive fields before sharing and compute a privacy score.

Technical notes:
- Evaluate existing Rust crates for IPTC/XMP (and adapt for WASM where needed).
- Consider a fall‚Äëback lightweight JS parser for specific formats if unavoidable, behind a feature flag.
- All visualizations rendered locally (Canvas/SVG) with no external calls.
- ELA: re‚Äëencode at a set quality in‚Äëmemory and diff; ensure performance safeguards.

Testing & acceptance:
- Regression suite of sample files across vendors and formats.
- Golden tests for parsed structures (EXIF/IPTC/XMP) and exports.
- Visual regression tests for charts/heatmaps (snapshot PNG or DOM assertions in wasm tests).

---

## Phase 4 ‚Äî Formats, Platforms, and Packaging

Objectives: broaden file format compatibility and distribution options while maintaining the privacy promise.

User‚Äëfacing features:
- Additional formats (best‚Äëeffort, feature‚Äëflagged by browser support):
  - HEIC/HEIF metadata extraction (where browser decoders or libraries allow).
  - RAW subsets (DNG focus) for metadata only; no full raw decode.
  - Minimal video metadata: container atoms (MP4/MOV), codec, duration, and embedded EXIF/XMP where present.
- Packaging:
  - Browser extension (WebExtension) variant that adds a context menu: ‚ÄúInspect metadata‚Äù on images.
  - Bookmarklet / URL import (optional, with CORS caveats): paste URL to fetch and inspect; explicit user action, not required for core.
  - Standalone static build with service worker for easy offline distribution.

Technical notes:
- Use feature gating to keep the core bundle lean and only enable format‚Äëspecific code in targeted builds.
- WebCodecs API investigation for HEIF/AVIF support paths (capability detection at runtime).
- MP4 box parser in Rust/WASM for container metadata only (no decode).

Testing & acceptance:
- Capability matrix per browser; graceful fallbacks when unsupported.
- Size and performance budgets per packaging target.
- CORS handling documented for URL import; never required for core features.

## Cross‚ÄëCutting Concerns

Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA):
- Semantic structure, focus order, skip links, ARIA where needed.
- High‚Äëcontrast theme and reduced motion option.
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (open, select all, export, clean).

Security & privacy:
- Strict CSP, COOP/COEP for threading, no eval.
- No network requests for core features; make optional external link opening explicit.
- Validate and sanitize file inputs; defensive parsing with safe Rust APIs.
- Local privacy: keep all caches opt‚Äëin with clear controls to purge.

Performance:
- Web Workers by default for heavy tasks; OffscreenCanvas when available.
- Consider Rayon‚Äëlike threading in WASM (when cross‚Äëorigin isolation is enabled).
- SIMD for hot paths if it materially improves performance.
- Deterministic outputs and stable sort orders for reproducible exports.

Internationalization:
- Localized UI and field explanations.
- Locale switcher with persisted preference; no runtime network fetches.
- Right‚Äëto‚Äëleft layout support where applicable.

Developer experience:
- Expand wasm‚Äëbindgen tests covering UI logic in components.
- Add property‚Äëbased tests for parsing edge cases.
- Tooling tasks: bundle size check, flamegraph‚Äëlike profiling notes for WASM.
- JSON schema definitions for exports with versioning and compatibility tests.

## Tracking

Each epic should have:
- Design doc (short) with acceptance criteria.
- Test plan and sample files.
- Performance budget and measurement notes.
- Schema/versioning notes for export stability where applicable.

If you spot TODOs in code during implementation, create corresponding issues and link them back to the epic. Keep PRs small and focused.
