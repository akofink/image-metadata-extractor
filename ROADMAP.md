# Roadmap: Image Metadata Extractor (Client‑Side Only)

This roadmap outlines a privacy‑first, fully client‑side evolution of the Image Metadata Extractor. It is organized into phases with clear goals, user‑facing features, technical notes, and testing criteria. Dates are intentionally omitted; sequence may adapt based on community needs and browser platform capabilities.

Guiding principles:
- 100% client‑side (no servers, no tracking, no external storage of user data).
- Privacy by design (opt‑in UI features, safe defaults, no network calls required for core features).
- Rust + WebAssembly + Yew (type safety, performance, maintainability).
- Performance and accessibility are first‑class requirements.

Non‑goals:
- No server‑side processing or persistent cloud storage.
- No analytics/telemetry that sends data off device.
- No reliance on paid third‑party APIs for core functionality.

## What will make this the most useful tool on the Internet

Unique differentiators (all client‑side):
- **Archive & dataset native**: Import ZIP/7z/TAR archives, deduplicate by hash, and process at scale without uploading files anywhere.
- **Cross‑file intelligence**: Timeline view, location clustering heatmap, and cross‑image diff/dedupe to analyze entire shoots.
- **Privacy score & guidance**: Automatic sensitive‑field warnings, GPS precision fuzzing, and share‑safety checklist with clear remediation.
- **Templated reporting**: Custom, user‑defined report templates (Markdown/HTML/TXT) with local profile storage and schema versioning.
- **Minimal video metadata**: Parse container metadata (MP4/MOV) and embedded XMP/EXIF sidecar basics to extend usefulness beyond still images.
- **Power‑user experience**: Command palette, keyboard shortcuts, rule‑based redaction engine, and offline quick‑map preview (no external tiles).
- **Internationalization**: Built‑in multilingual UI and field explanations, shipped with the app (no network fetch).
- **Forensic analysis suite**: Error Level Analysis (ELA), timestamp anomaly detection, camera fingerprinting, and provenance tracking.
- **AI-powered insights**: Automated privacy risk assessment, suspicious modification detection, and smart field categorization.
- **Professional workflow integration**: Export profiles for journalism, law enforcement, real estate, and research use cases.
- **Advanced visualization**: Interactive GPS tracks, photo timeline correlation, and metadata trend analysis across collections.
- **Enterprise features**: Audit trails, compliance reporting, and bulk processing with customizable rules engines.

## Phase 4 — Formats, Platforms, and Packaging

Objectives: broaden file format compatibility and distribution options while maintaining the privacy promise.

User‑facing features:
- Additional formats (best‑effort, feature‑flagged by browser support):
  - HEIC/HEIF metadata extraction (where browser decoders or libraries allow).
  - RAW subsets (DNG focus) for metadata only; no full raw decode.
  - Minimal video metadata: container atoms (MP4/MOV), codec, duration, and embedded EXIF/XMP where present.
- Packaging:
  - Browser extension (WebExtension) variant that adds a context menu: “Inspect metadata” on images.
  - Bookmarklet / URL import (optional, with CORS caveats): paste URL to fetch and inspect; explicit user action, not required for core.
  - Standalone static build with service worker for easy offline distribution.

Technical notes:
- Use feature gating to keep the core bundle lean and only enable format‑specific code in targeted builds.
- WebCodecs API investigation for HEIF/AVIF support paths (capability detection at runtime).
- MP4 box parser in Rust/WASM for container metadata only (no decode).

Testing & acceptance:
- Capability matrix per browser; graceful fallbacks when unsupported.
- Size and performance budgets per packaging target.
- CORS handling documented for URL import; never required for core features.

## Cross‑Cutting Concerns

Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA):
- Semantic structure, focus order, skip links, ARIA where needed.
- High‑contrast theme and reduced motion option.
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (open, select all, export, clean).

Security & privacy:
- Strict CSP, COOP/COEP for threading, no eval.
- No network requests for core features; make optional external link opening explicit.
- Validate and sanitize file inputs; defensive parsing with safe Rust APIs.
- Local privacy: keep all caches opt‑in with clear controls to purge.

Performance:
- Web Workers by default for heavy tasks; OffscreenCanvas when available.
- Consider Rayon‑like threading in WASM (when cross‑origin isolation is enabled).
- SIMD for hot paths if it materially improves performance.
- Deterministic outputs and stable sort orders for reproducible exports.

Internationalization:
- Localized UI and field explanations.
- Locale switcher with persisted preference; no runtime network fetches.
- Right‑to‑left layout support where applicable.

Developer experience:
- Expand wasm‑bindgen tests covering UI logic in components.
- Add property‑based tests for parsing edge cases.
- Tooling tasks: bundle size check, flamegraph‑like profiling notes for WASM.
- JSON schema definitions for exports with versioning and compatibility tests.
