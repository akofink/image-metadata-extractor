Continue implementing high impact features on our roadmap, defined in Roadmap.md. As you implement features from the roadmap, ensure the readme is updated, and the Roadmap.md is also updated to accurately reflect the current state of what is implemented (Readme.md) vs. what we want to implement in the future (Roadmap.md). Create small and encapsulated commits that are easy to review and understand. Each commit should ideally focus on a single feature or improvement, making it easier to track changes and revert if necessary. Use clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the change vs. what was changed (that can be seen from the diff, so it's redundant). This practice not only helps in maintaining a clean project history but also facilitates collaboration with other developers who may be working on the same codebase. Pay attention to pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency before finalizing your commits. Fix any issues that arise from these hooks to maintain a high standard of code quality. Stop only once the working directory has no uncommitted changes, ensuring that all intended modifications are properly committed and documented.
